##Random Forest

Our final model is our most complex and long winded: the random forest. We will follow the same steps to set it up, and We will start by setting up the engine and the model:

```{r}
forest_spec <- rand_forest() %>% 
  set_engine("ranger", importance = 'impurity') %>% 
  set_mode("regression") %>% 
  set_args(mtry = tune(),
           trees = tune(),
           min_n = tune())
```

Then the workflow:

```{r}
forest_wf <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(forest_spec) %>% 
  add_recipe(abnb_recipe)
```

Then the grid:

```{r}
param_grid_forest <- grid_regular(mtry(range = c(1,10)), min_n(range = c(5,20)),
                           trees(range = c(100, 500)), levels = 8)
```

And after all that we finish off by tuning the model:

```{r}
start.time <- Sys.time()

tune_forest <- tune_grid(
  forest_wf,
  resamples = abnb_folds,
  grid = param_grid_forest,
  metrics = metric_set(rmse, rsq)
)

end.time <- Sys.time()
time.taken <- round(end.time - start.time,2)
time.taken

write_rds(tune_forest, file =
            '/Users/Sofia/Documents/GitHub/Final_Project_Airbnb/results/rf_results')
```
